# Copy Yoast Metadesc to Excerpt

This WordPress plugin that copies all yoast metadesc to the the post excerpt with the click of a button.

[Yoast automatically uses excerpts for metadesc values](https://yoast.com/ask-yoast-meta-descriptions-and-the-excerpt-field/). You may be working on a client site that previously ignored the excerpt field but now needs to used them. Instead of manually copying over yoast metadesc data to the excerpt field, this plugin does it for you.

This plugin also adds the admin column `Yoast metadesc matches excerpt?` with an indicator showing true or false.

**Disclaimer**

This plugin was made as a quick solution for a client issue and may not work for every site. Make sure to backup your database before using.
